# Risk Return Analysis

**Overview**
----
This python project contains data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for key risk and return metrics to compare the S&P 500 to four other portfolios. The project will calculate risk and return metrics, like the daily returns, standard deviation, sharpe ratio and beta. It will provide the ability to identify the most appropriate risk-and-return portfolio to invest in.

**Requirements**
----
This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

*[pandas]GitHub at: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas - For fast, powerful and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool built on Python*

*[anaconda]Anaconda at: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ - For install directions for Anaconda in order to use Jupyter Lab*

*[jupyterlab]JupyterLab at: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ - For creation and running of programs using Python*

Go to your terminal or git bash and run conda activate dev to activate your conda dev environment. You will then install the following librarie(s) and module(s) to run in Python codes you create. Install pandas by conda install pandas or pip install pandas. Pathlib and Numpy should be ready to install in your code.

**Instruction**
----
Go to the Anaconda Prompt to launch JupyterLab by typing Jupyter Lab. To use this application simply clone the repository and run the risk_return_analysis.ipynb in you Jupyter Lab Notebook.
